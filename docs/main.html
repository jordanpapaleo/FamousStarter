        <h1>Famous Platform API Documentation</h1>
        <p class="promo-text">Famous is a platform for building user-interfaces. It's written in JavaScript and features high-performance rendering capabilities across both DOM and WebGL. Included is a fully integrated 3D physics engine and a handful of other utilities for UI creation.</p>
        <p>Famous was built from the ground up to bring 60 FPS animations to any screen. Because it's rooted in web technilogies, Famous applications can go anywhere: browser, device, jumbotron. Famous' internal architecture takes inspiration from AAA game engines, breaking out of document-based UI limitations with a full fledged scene graph that developers can access at a low level.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Understanding the <em>scene graph</em> is key to understanding the Famous platform. In Famous, all display elements are associated with a <em>render node</em> which can be decorated with visual characteristics such as size, rotation, position, and style. Render nodes are maintained by Famous as vertices in a tree data structure. Its hierarchy is used to group visual elements and apply additive transformations.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Although the Famous platform is built in web technologies, building UIs with Famous is very much unlike traditional web development. It might seem unusual, especially if you're accustomed to building UIs with conventional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Notions like <em>normal flow</em> and <em>floated elements</em>, the bread and butter of modern websites, are peripheral or avoided completely when using Famous.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>To start developing with Famous, we recommend beginning with one of the <em>seed projects</em> which you can clone to your local workstation and then modify. Begin by using Git to clone down Famous' main seed repository:</p>
        <pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:Famous/seed.git</code></pre>
        <br>
        <p>Once the repository has finished being cloned down, change directories into the seed project, and then run the following command to install dependencies (you'll need to make sure you have <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> installed before attempting this command):</p>
        <pre><code>$ npm install</code></pre>
        <br>
        <p>Finally, start up the local development server by running the following command. Once the development server begins running, you should be able to visit <a href="http://localhost:1337">http://localhost:1337</a> in your favorite browser and see a spinning Famous logo. If not, please visit our section on <a href="#">troubleshooting</a>.</p>
        <pre><code>$ npm run develop</code></pre>
